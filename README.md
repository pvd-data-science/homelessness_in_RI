## Improving Services for the Homeless and Housing Insecure

### Summary: 
We will work with various organizations & institutions serving the homeless and housing insecure population in Rhode Island to understand the landscape of policy, data, and interventions. Our aims will range from facilitating data collection for outreach workers to predictive modeling to estimate vulnerability based on anonymized individual-level data, with the ultimate goal of making quantitative policy recommendations.

### Contribution:
   • Streamline the data pipeline for organizations working to support the homeless, so they can spend less time on records-keeping and more time on outreach.
   • *Evaluating the VI-SPDAT*: the VI-SPDAT is a vulnerability assessment tool that RI uses to prioritize housing assistance. I am writing a proposal to assess the utility of this tool using the state's own data (the HMIS database), and you can view the current draft at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f0tBPfMO_DRAU-4jlUwD0JPrXjYdwscgeTtkWr1-W3Y/edit?usp=sharing. The current hurdle is how do I guarantee the privacy and security of the dataset, since it contains sensitive private information. We are exploring the possibility of using Brown University's Stronghold Research Environment for this purpose.
   • Explore utility of "extra" data that do not go into the state database

### Approach:
   • Build connections with organizations that are active in this field
   • Automate workflows
   • Request data that are not publicly viewable
   • Some machine learning, eventually!

### Challenges:
   • Data access - depends in part on ensuring data security
   • Line of inquiry will depend in part on what data can be obtained
   • Learning Python on-the-fly (coming over from the R side!)
